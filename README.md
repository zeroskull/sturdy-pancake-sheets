## **Getting Started**

- Download the `sheets.zip` file from the [latest release.](https://github.com/zeroskull/sturdy-pancake-sheets/releases/latest)
- Decide which style of sheet you would like to use for your character.
  - Descriptions and Examples are provided below. Links to relevant sections are located in the Table of Contents above.
- Use the option "Actual Size" when printing the PDFs.
  - If you do not have the "Actual Size" option in your Print Dialog, try using Adobe Acrobat.
- Use the PDF viewer in Firefox to add text to the PDFs.
  - If you want to print the sheet to use in person, remember to not add text to fields that you will have to edit.
- If you would like to edit the layout or content of the sheets, download the `.svg` files in the `svgs` folder from this Git Repo.
  - These sheets were designed in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), but any vector graphics software, like Adobe Illustrator, should work.

## **Traditional Sheets**

- A more standard format for a TTRPG Character.
- Most information contained on one page.
- Separate pages for more complex characters and notes.

## **Card Sheets**

- A more experimental format for a TTRPG Character.
- All the elements of a character sectioned into smaller pieces.
- Ability to customize you Character Sheet layout at the table.
- Using the Card Sheets
  - Print at "Actual Size" or "100% Scaling" for the best accuracy.
  - Use scissors, or a blade and straight edge, to cut along the dotted lines.
  - The card's dimensions are 63 mm x 88 mm, so they should fit inside of standard card sleeves.
  - Fold larger elements in half for more convenient storage.
